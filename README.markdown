# Data Access Object Demo App.

This demonstrates an implementation of the [Data Access Object](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_access_object) design pattern as an iOS To-Do application. 

The app consists of three main targets:

 - `DataAccessObject-Demo.app` — the main application.
 - `ReminderDataModel.framework` — defines the data model of the application on an abstract level.
 - `CoreDataModelImp.framework` — implements the data model using Core Data

The unit test targets are present as they were generated by Xcode but not implemented, being a demo app.

For more information of the app, visit [my technical blog](https://cutecoder.org).

## Requirements

- Xcode 10.2.1
- Swift 5.0
- iOS 12.2
